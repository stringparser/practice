# Learning computer languages

I've found the approach of this site:

    http://www.learnpython.org/

very appealing what to go through when learning a new language. This are the bullet points:

- Hello, World!
- Variables and Types
- Lists
- Basic Operators
- String Formatting
- Basic String Operations
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes and Objects
- Dictionaries
- Modules and Packages

That is true for any language, maybe I'll add more later on.
